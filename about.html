                    Ladli Foundation (USA)  is  a registered NJ non-profit organization, an international wing of Ladli foundation trust which  has gained the reputed Special Consultative Status with Economic and Social Council, United Nations (ECOSOC) in the year 2020.

                Driven by the motive of upliftment of women, Ladli Foundation was established as a grassroot  level  non-profit organization. With a mission of building an inclusive, gender sensitized society with equal access to essential healthcare and educational amenities, the foundation has been diligently working in 50 districts across 10 states in India. It is a registered entity under Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), Niti Aayog and officially associated with Delhi Police and other Departments of Government in India. The international wing of this organization will serve as a centre for females who have been survivors of domestic violence and are in need of help in order to reform their lives and attain an identity of their own. The organization will also be a facilitator of dialogue with The United Nations and their other organs and shall serve as a considerable role in bridging the gap between developing and developed countries making them more socially interdependent.
                
                 Ladli actively promotes Gender Equality, and creates reformative opportunities for youth via advancing cognizance among the underprivileged sections of the society. Holding a strong belief in expunging social taboos and communal tyranny against women, the foundation is installing diverse projects on the ground level in synchrony with the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals. Having over 1 million beneficiaries already has brought recognition to the organization and its intensive efforts of community outreach over the years. Similarly, its unit in the U.S.A aims to build a strong community of females who have survived violence and other atrocities and are looking for opportunities for their upliftment and growth.
